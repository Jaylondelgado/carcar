## Design

## Service microservice

I will add the services into the inventory microservice and
make my models and views to show the list of my model. I will write 
the paths to my views and check my work on Insomnia. I will add to 
my views to handle POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests for all services.
That will complete my back end. Next I will start on the front-end by polling for 
the automobiles for the vin. Then I will begin creating my React files 
and building my React components to fetch and show the lists and complete 
the forms. After I will implement the d-none for my finished projects. 
Then I will work on the search bar for the service history. My two biggest
struggles were implementing the appointment form on react and also
creating the search bar with search history. I do however believe 
I learned a lot throughout this project, I came in not knowing what to do
with certain errors and I was able to overcome that and began fixing the problem
realitvely quick.
